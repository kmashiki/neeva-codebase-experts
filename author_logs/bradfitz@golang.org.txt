commit 351c15f1cee364a91ef606ef9114d55247a6a0c2

    all: remove public named return values when useless
    
    Named returned values should only be used on public funcs and methods
    when it contributes to the documentation.
    
    Named return values should not be used if they're only saving the
    programmer a few lines of code inside the body of the function,
    especially if that means there's stutter in the documentation or it
    was only there so the programmer could use a naked return
    statement. (Naked returns should not be used except in very small
    functions)
    
    This change is a manual audit & cleanup of public func signatures.
    
    Signatures were not changed if:
    
    * the func was private (wouldn't be in public godoc)
    * the documentation referenced it
    * the named return value was an interesting name. (i.e. it wasn't
      simply stutter, repeating the name of the type)
    
    There should be no changes in behavior. (At least: none intended)
