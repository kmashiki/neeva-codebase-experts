## Git Log Parsing
- Find anyone who has ever contributed to this repo: `git shortlog -s -n -e --all --no-merges <dir>`
- logs_by_author_obj = {}
- Loop through authors: for a in authors
    - Log = `git log --stat --author=<a.email> <dir>`
    - logs_by_author_obj[email].append(Log)
- stats_by_author_obj = {}
- Loop through logs to run stats per author: for email, logs in logs_by_author_obj.items()
    - stats_by_author_obj[email][num_commits] = len(logs)
    - …
- expert_score_by_author_obj = {}
- Loop through each author: for a in authors
    - Score = Run heuristic on all stats in stats_by_author
    - expert_score_by_author_obj[a] = score
- Sort logs_by_author_obj by score (i.e., value)


## Git Blame Parsing
- blame_by_author_obj = {}
- Find each file in directory
- Loop through files
    - run `git blame <file>`
- Loop through git blame dump files: for f in files
    - Loop through each line
        - A = parse_author
        - Year = parse_year
        - Line = parse_code_from_blame
        - If a in blame_by_author_obj keys
            - blame_by_author_obj[a][‘num_lines_contributed’][year] ++
            - Check year as well
            - If line.startswith(‘//‘)
                - Increment num lines commented code
            - else
                - Increment num lines code
        - Else
            - blame_by_author_obj[a] = {num_lines_contributed: {year: 1}}
- expert_score_by_author_obj = {}
- Loop through each author: for a in authors
    - Score = Run heuristic on all stats in stats_by_author
    - expert_score_by_author_obj[a] = score
- Sort logs_by_author_obj by score (i.e., value)
